Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Go above and beyond what’s required.</h3>
              <p>Going above and beyond is about more than just doing what’s necessary to get a story. You need to be more than just a good writer in today’s journalism market. When you write a story, don’t stop at the minimum to get the job done. Think about what you’d want out of the article if you were a reader, and try to give them that.</p> 
              
              <p>- Make yourself more marketable by expanding your technical skills. Knowing how to use more programs, do basic coding, and use creative software will help you get your voice out there and will make you more marketable.</p>
              
              <p>- If possible, beat your deadlines. While you don’t want to rush your work, you do want to provide your publisher with a speedy product so that your article will be timely.</p>

              <h3>Make sacrifices.</h3>
              <p>You may have to give up your free time or miss out on fun events with friends in order to meet your journalism goals. Writing is usually a solitary activity, so it may be a sacrifice for you to miss out on that social time. You may also need to sacrifice earning potential or social connections if you write about polarizing issues.</p>
              
              <p>- When you’re faced with sacrifices, ask yourself what’s more important to you. Ask, “Where do I want to be in five years? How will this sacrifice impact my five-year goal?”</p>

              <p>Journalists get information from a variety of sources, so you’ll need to know how to gather, assess, and organize information on your own. Research consists of more than just doing a Google search. You need to be able to find the information you need in print sources, by talking to knowledgeable individuals, and by sorting through relevant materials, such as letters, memos, or file documents.</p>

              <p>- Consider getting a degree in something else along with journalism to make you a more informed writer.</p>
              <p>- If you want to cover world events, consider studying languages.</p>

Anything can be relevant from a journalistic standpoint, so keep yourself open and learn the current trends. You’ll produce better stories and get your readers what they want if you know what’s going on.</p>

              <p>- For example, if someone tells you that they knew the subject of your story when they were in college, make sure they were really in college together.</p>
